Mariana Montes studied Italian Language and Literature at the Universidad Nacional de Córdoba (Argentina), from which she graduated in 2016. There she worked for four years on metaphors of the source-domain ‘temperature’ in written corpora of Spanish and Italian, from a cognitive linguistics perspective. She started her PhD in 2017 under the supervision of Dirk Geeraerts and Dirk Speelman, in the Nephological Semantics Project.
Her main research interests lie in corpus linguistics and cognitive semantics, but she’s also interested in visual analytics. The goal of her PhD project is to understand token-level vector space models, exploring the relationship between parameter settings and aspects of meaning revealed by the models, with case studies in English and Dutch. During this research she has also developed a tool for semantic annotation and advanced the development of a visualization tool, both available in her GitHub account.
