abstract: In this Master Thesis I analize the metaphorical use of several terms
   from the TEMPERATURE domain in a reference corpus of written Italian from a cognitive framework.
   After indentifying the conceptual metaphors involved, I classify the evaluated entities
   in order to study their relationship to the different terms and the target domains.
   Thus, the research contributes to a richer description of such terms by including
   the experiences they describe, either in reference to their physical temperature or
   to other domains metaphorically conceptualized in terms of heat or cold.
