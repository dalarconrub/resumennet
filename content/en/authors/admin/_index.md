My name is Mariana Montes (boringly, in IPA: [ma'rja:na 'montes]) and I am a Doctor in Linguistics discovering new passions in R, R Markdown and Data visualization.

I studied Italian Language and Literature at the Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba (Argentina, where I'm from) and graduated in 2016 with a thesis on [metaphorical usage of temperature terms in Italian](https://rdu.unc.edu.ar/bitstream/handle/11086/14119/Mariana%20Montes.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). The degree is a "Licenciatura", which takes 5 years and counts as both Bachelor and Master. Towards the end of 2017
I came to Belgium and started [the path I'm on now](https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/ling/qlvl/people/pages/00118974). I defended mi PhD at KU Leuven on September 21, 2021.

I really really like languages, to study them and study about them. I also got into statistics and programming (which you need for that kind of work), and these skills exploded in the past few years. I get so excited with everything I learned that I want to use this space not just to introduce myself to whoever might be interested, but also to share the wonderful things I find. Next to Python and R (and the whole world that R Markdown offers), I got to learn Javascript and use it for [data visualization](https://qlvl.github.io/NephoVis/).

Next to the academic and virtual lives I enjoy aikido and iaido, walking in green spaces, reading and baking. I also drink mate (ðŸ§‰), a lot, and it's very much part of who I am.
