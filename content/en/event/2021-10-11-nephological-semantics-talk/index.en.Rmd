On October 1st, 2021, [Karlien Franco](https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/ling/qlvl/people/pages/00076167) and I gave a (long) talk about the [Nephological Semantics project](../../project/nephological-semantics): Cognitive Sociolinguistics, Distributional Semantics and some case studies. It was a wonderful experience made possible by [Nuria Gómez Belart](https://www.nuriagomezbelart.com/), [Araceli Alemán](https://salvador.academia.edu/AraceliAlem%C3%A1n) and the rest of the organizing committee of the II Jornadas de Lingüística y Gramática Española at the USAL (Buenos Aires, Argentina).

The talk was also simultaneously interpreted to Spanish by [Pilar Petrone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pilar-petrone-611150180/?originalSubdomain=ar) and [Valeria Dorrego](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeria-dorrego-aa0073a9/); you can watch that video [here](https://youtu.be/lpqgBXZfuPc).
As you can see, all slides (available above) are bilingual.
