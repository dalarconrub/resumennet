abstract: The present study is part of the
  Nephological Semantics research project at QLVL,
  which aims to develop tools for large-scale
  corpus-based semantic analyses.
  A core aspect of the project involves representing
  semantic structure with vector space models
  (VSMs), a computational tool that currently
  requires a deeper understanding of its inner
  workings and how its results relate to cognitive
  theories of meaning.
