<p>There is a lot out there written about R, R Markdown and all its family of tools.
Most of what I have learned about it I got from Out There, by googling what I needed.
I expect anyone reading this can do that too. These posts will help me organize and
credit all those amazing sources that have made my own progress and learning possible
and enjoyable. Ideally they will also reach other people that can benefit from my
findings and that –even better!– may have ideas to share themselves.</p>
<p>I have always liked to write, and for many years did most of it in MS Word and really enjoyed it.
I love writing, I love formatting, I love seeing words in a beautiful environment and
feeling all cozy inside, maybe just because I like the font. I do not underestimate
the effect that graphics, colors, layout, sizes, margins, etc., have in my emotions,
and therefore in my mood, my enthusiasm, my performance. Language is not only about
the <em>what</em>, but very much about the <em>how</em>.</p>
<p>About 5 years ago I was introduced to <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span>. I was not sure what I could get from
it, because most of its advantages seemed to be related to STEM-related writing, which
(back then) I was not doing. However, the neat output that required so little tweaking,
after a horrible-looking input that focused more on content, captivated me. I was
looking forward to move from MS Word to <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span>, and fearful of assignments that
would require an MS Word output.</p>
<p>I started my PhD position in Leuven shortly after, and my <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> experience was
limited to a professional-looking CV and a chapter for what I thought was going
to be my PhD thesis. I didn’t really write for a while, in this new position –mostly
notes, for which I like to use Evernote. However, I did ask a colleague about what he
used to write papers, given the requirements of different journals… and he said “R Markdown.”</p>
<p>“You can just check the cheatsheet online,” he said. That was all. I took note of it for the future, but that was it for a while.
I didn’t have chance to use it immediately (not that I could see, at least).
I was already using R and R Studio, getting more and more familiar, but very slowly,
and I certainly didn’t see it as a <em>word processor</em>.</p>
<p>After a year or so, my R code was looking more complex and interesting, a whole
story in a programming language. The comments I needed to understand what was going
on, to remember the links between the pieces of code, were growing into full paragraphs.
I wanted to document what I was doing properly, ideally close to the code itself.
And R Markdown <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rmarkdown2018" role="doc-biblioref">Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-rmarkdown2020" role="doc-biblioref">Xie, Dervieux, and Riederer 2020</a>)</span> is perfect for that.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I could create texts that interlaced the documentation,
my thinking process,
and code –maybe the code itself was not visible in the final output, but the
source document remains available and is quite readable itself. And that final output…</p>
<p>First, you can have the same pretty PDFs you get with <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span>, and include
<span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> expressions (like I’m doing here with the logo). Second, you can also
have MS Word output, in case you need to write a paper with it as requirement (I only
did that much later).
Third –and foremost, in my opinion–, you can have HTML output. Beautiful,
endless scrolling HTML, with collapsable table of contents, responsive features,
tabs, and so much more! This seemed even more enticing given that I had been exploring
HTML and CSS for a while (CSS is what you use to style HTML), so I could personalize
and enhance my HTML’s even more.</p>
<p>I started writing reports, merging documentation, code, visualization, and ideas.
I explored new templates, like those from <code>rmdformats</code> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-R-rmdformats" role="doc-biblioref">Barnier 2021</a>)</span>.
I wrote so much code for them that then I moved them to specialized scripts.
I wrote so many scripts that I created a private package for most of them.
I started writing my dissertation in <code>bookdown</code> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bookdown2016" role="doc-biblioref">Xie 2016</a>)</span>,
and gave a talk about it with <code>xaringan</code> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-R-xaringan" role="doc-biblioref">Xie 2021</a>)</span>.
I created this site with <code>blogdown</code> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-blogdown2017" role="doc-biblioref">Xie, Hill, and Thomas 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>I grew so much in R, and I would not have anticipated it when I first started looking
into corpus linguistics in 2013 and a professor suggested I “use R,” as if a single letter was
enough to find anything about it. It certainly is –the community is solid and active,
and I look forward to giving at least half what I’ve received from it ❤️.</p>
